The root «[[se]]» means "action" or "event". Here, Bob is equating it to «[[arote]] [[su]]», or "meeting //of// you", which is a "meeting" that is //of//, //about//, //with//, or //in some way related to// "you". So the [[equational phrase|Equational phrase]] «[[se]][[n]] [[arote]] [[su]]» can roughly be translated as "to meet you".

Because this entire EP has been assigned to «[[tete]]» (recall that a word ending in «-[[n]]» is set equal to what follows it), what Bob is saying is that he "feels happy" («[[kemi]][[n]] [[tira]]»), and the "topic" («[[tete]]») of this feeling is equal to "meeting you" («[[se]][[n]] [[arote]] [[su]]»).
