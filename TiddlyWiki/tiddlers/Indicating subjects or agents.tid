title: Indicating subjects or agents
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In many terrestrial languages, the prototypical subject of a sentence is the entity responsible for the state or action. For example, in the sentence "The cat ate her food", the phrase "the cat" is the subject since the cat is the one //doing the eating//, whereas the food is what's //getting eaten//. In [[thematic|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_relation]] terms, this kind of subject is termed an "agent".

In Asgardian, agents are indicated with the word [[paku]]. To indicate //who// is doing an action is as simple as setting [[paku]] equal to the phrase specifying the agent, and using this as a secondary equation in the sentence.

|!Asgardian|>|>|>|>|>|>| [[Re|re]] [[na]] [[rotuki]][[,]] [[paku]] [[ne]] [[i]][[.|FS]] |
|~| [[Re|re]] | [[na]] | [[rotuki]] | [[,]] | [[paku]] | [[ne]] | [[i]][[.|FS]] |
|!English| event | = | walking| | agent | = | me |
|~|>|>| walking is happening | |>|>| I'm doing it |
|~|>|>|>|>|>|>| I am walking. |

Note the usage of [[ne]] to indicate the secondary equation, as well as the comma to separate the equations from one another. While it is not incorrect to use [[na]] in both equations, the usage of [[ne]] helps show that the emphasis is on the event (walking), not on the doer thereof. Incidentally, if a speaker did want to emphasize that they were the one doing the walking, then a sentence like "[[paku]] [[na]] [[i]][[,]] [[re]] [[ne]] [[rotuki]]" would do so ("action being walking, the agent is me").
