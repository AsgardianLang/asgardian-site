''Usage notes:''
A [[na]] B means "A is B". Specifically, this expresses either identity (A refers to the same thing as B), class membership (A is an example of B), or fulfillment of a role or "slot" (B is the A). These latter two functions can be specified more explicitly with special roots, if needed.
