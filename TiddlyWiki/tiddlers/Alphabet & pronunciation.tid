title: Alphabet & pronunciation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

To maximize compatibility and readability on various devices and platforms, Asgardian uses the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet]]. While there are no formal prohibitions on using proper nouns or personal names spelled using all the letters from A to Z (or even non-Latin characters), the core Asgardian vocabulary is built around a more restricted set of sounds common to the majority of world languages, and the limited alphabet used for these words is reflective of this decision:  ''A E H I K M N O P R S T U''.

The "English" columns in the following tables reflect the approximate pronunciation in terms of common US English words. The "IPA" columns provide a more precise specification in terms of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet]], and the symbols can be clicked on to hear a recording of the correct sound. 

If more than one symbol is specified for a given Asgardian letter, that means a variety of pronunciations are acceptable; this is primarily to accommodate speakers who may not have the exact sound in their native language, but will likely have one close enough for a good approximation. In such cases, the first symbol represents the canonical or "standard" pronunciation.

!!Consonant pronunciation notes:

* ''P'', ''T'', and ''K'' may be voiced, unvoiced, aspirated, or unaspirated.
* ''T'' and ''D'' may be dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar, as long as they are apical (but see below).
* When followed by the vowel ''I'', the consonants ''T'' and ''S'' may be palatalized.
* Stops may be voiced intervocalically, so long as ''D'' [d] does not get confused with ''R'' [ɾ] (as can happen in the American English pronunciation of [["ladder" / "latter"|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapping]].

!!Vowel pronunciation notes

Sometimes, two vowels may occur next to each other in the same root. In this case, one of them will always be an ''I'' or ''U''. When next to another vowel, ''I'' may be pronounced as "y" in English (the semivowel [j]), and ''U'' may be pronounced as "w" (the semivowel [w]). If ''I'' or ''U'' are pronounced this way, and are the first vowel in a root, the following vowel may receive stress instead without a change of meaning. In the root «[[kia]]», for example, there is no difference in meaning among the pronunciations of ['kia], [ki'a], ['kija], [ki'ja], [kja], or [kʲa].

!!Stress

Stress does not distinguish root meanings in Asgardian, but learners may find the following patterns helpful to help discern the onset of a new root.

* ''Primary stress'': All roots in Asgardian are stressed on the first full vowel (which may be the second orthographic vowel if a leading ''I'' or ''U'' is pronounced as a semivowel). Stress can be realized as a higher pitch, a louder volume, a longer duration, or all/any of the above. Some speakers may prefer to pronounce unstressed ''a'' as "uh", like in the English word "sof__a__" ([[schwa|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa]]).

* ''Secondary stress'': If helpful for pronunciation, secondary stress may be placed on alternating vowels after the primary stressed vowel. For example, the word [[takima]] receives primary stress on the first ''a'', and may receive secondary stress on the second.


!Exercise

For practice, read the following words out loud, using the Asgardian rules for pronunciation.

* [[su]], [[i]], [[kia]], [[se]]
* [[teka]], [[tope]], [[nepi]], [[kupo]], [[sonu]], [[rima]], [[siu]], [[turi]]
* [[ehari]], [[sekuse]], [[totaki]], [[emoto]], [[kause]]
