All syllables in native Asgardian roots are restricted to the type CV (Consonant-Vowel), with the [[null consonant|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_consonant]] or [[glottal stop|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop]] used to create vowel-only syllables (e.g., the root «[[api]]» is underlyingly /'ʔapi/). Intervocalically, glottal stops can be [[elided|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision]] entirely, or pronounced as a [[hiatus|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics)]]. For any two adjacent vowels, at least one must be an ''I'' or ''U''. As such, sequences of two vowels may also be pronounced as [[diphthongs|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong]] (see [[Stress]] for details).

A root may receive the ending «-[[n]]» when it is used as the target of assignment in an [[equational phrase|Equational phrase]]. This «-[[n]]» may be pronounced as a [[coda consonant|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable#Coda]] in the final syllable, or as a [[syllabic nasal|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabic_consonant]] in its own right.
