Now let's try creating an [[Assignment Phrase|Assignment phrase]] with a real Asgardian root. The root «[[sonu]]» means "name" or "what one is called". Therefore, the AP «[[sonu]][[n]] __&emsp;&emsp;__» can be translated as "name equals __&emsp;&emsp;__", "called __&emsp;&emsp;__" or "to be named __&emsp;&emsp;__". Congratulations! You've just made your first EP, and your first Asgardian sentence!

|!Asgardian| [[Sonu|sonu]][[n]] | __&emsp;&emsp;__. |
|!English| name= | __&emsp;&emsp;__ |
|~|>|(My) name is __&emsp;&emsp;__. |
