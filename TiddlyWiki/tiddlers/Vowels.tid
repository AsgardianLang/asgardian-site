!!Vowel pronunciation notes

Sometimes, two vowels may occur next to each other in the same root. In this case, one of them will always be an ''I'' or ''U''. When next to another vowel, ''I'' may be pronounced as "y" in English (the semivowel [j]), and ''U'' may be pronounced as "w" (the semivowel [w]). If ''I'' or ''U'' are pronounced this way, and are the first vowel in a root, the following vowel may receive stress instead without a change of meaning. In the root «[[kia]]», for example, there is no difference in meaning among the pronunciations of ['kia], [ki'a], ['kija], [ki'ja], [kja], or [kʲa].
