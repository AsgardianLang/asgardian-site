Stress does not distinguish root meanings in Asgardian, but learners may find the following patterns helpful to help discern the onset of a new root.

* ''Primary stress'': All roots in Asgardian are stressed on the first full vowel (which may be the second orthographic vowel if a leading ''I'' or ''U'' is pronounced as a semivowel). Stress can be realized as a higher pitch, a louder volume, a longer duration, or all/any of the above.

* ''Secondary stress'': If helpful for pronunciation, secondary stress may be placed on alternating vowels after the primary stressed vowel. For example, the word [[takima]] receives primary stress on the first ''a'', and may receive secondary stress on the second.
