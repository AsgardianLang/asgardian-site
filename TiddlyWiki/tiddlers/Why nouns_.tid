title: Why nouns?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When learning a foreign language, evidence suggests that nouns are easier to acquire and use than verbs, both in natural and artificial (simulated) settings.

* [[Ludington (2012) - Factors Affecting Learning of Concrete Nouns and Verbs in a Foreign Language|https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3c34r8ts]]

In addition, a variety of studies have found that infants learning their native language acquire nouns more readily than verbs.

Students learning verbs often need to learn how they behave in terms of [[valency|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valency_(linguistics)]], [[transitivity|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitivity_(grammar)]], [[voice|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(grammar)]], and more. This can include unpredictable ordering or case-marking of arguments, as in the case of [[quirky subjects|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirky_subject]].

Nouns are readily linked together in equations, as can be see in [[equational sentences in terrestrial languages|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)]] as well as in the utility of [[named parameters in programming languages|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter]], not to mention [[equations in mathematics|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation]].

As a word class, nouns are [[easily expanded|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#Open_and_closed_classes]] through [[compounding|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)#Noun%E2%80%93noun_compounds]], and [[borrowing|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword]]. For example, when Japanese imported its large inventory of Chinese vocabulary items, [[the vast majority were brought in as nouns|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Japanese_vocabulary]]. Additionally, many languages make use of [[light verbs|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb]] in combination with semantically heavier [[verbal nouns|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_noun]] which actually carry the verbal meaning despite functioning grammatically as nouns, e.g. [[Irish verbnouns|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbnoun]] and [[periphrastic verb forms in Basque|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_verbs#Periphrastic_conjugation]], not to mention [[so-called “stretched verbs” in English|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_verb]].
