The "English" column in the following table reflects the approximate pronunciation in terms of common US English words. The "IPA" column provides a more precise specification in terms of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet]], and the symbols can be clicked on to hear a recording of the correct sound. 

If more than one symbol is specified for a given Asgardian letter, that means a variety of pronunciations are acceptable; this is primarily to accommodate speakers who may not have the exact sound in their native language, but will likely have one close enough for a good approximation. In such cases, the first symbol represents the canonical or "standard" pronunciation.
