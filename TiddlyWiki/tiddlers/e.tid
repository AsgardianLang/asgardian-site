* patient / object

!Notes

The root [[e]] indicates the less-active, more patient- or theme-like role in a state or event. It can be used to indicate the direct object (in the form of [[e]][[n]] [[X]], for "upon X" or "on X"), whether that object plays the role of patient or some other non-affected semantic role.
