Asgardian is an experimental (and expandable) constructed language that is built according to a set of defined [[principles|Principles of Asgardian]]. We hope it will provide a means by which Asgardians can express themselves and build a shared culture, free of the ties to accidents of Earthâ€™s history, while cultivating a unique, spacefaring identity in an easy-to-use medium, and that every sentence crafted in Asgardian brings its speakers one step closer to their goal a unified humanity.
