Asgardian is an experimental (and expandable) constructed language using noun-based equational grammar, and is built according to a set of defined [[principles|Principles of Asgardian]]. We hope it will provide a means by which Asgardians can express themselves and build a shared culture, free of the ties to accidents of Earthâ€™s history, while cultivating a unique, spacefaring identity in an easy-to-use medium, and that every sentence crafted in Asgardian brings its speakers one step closer to their goal a unified humanity. [[OHOU|ohou]][[!|EM]]

Asgardian grammar can be explained (or derived from) a handful of rules.

# [[Rule 1 - All root words are nouns|Rule 1]]
# [[Rule 2 - Later words modify earlier words|Rule 2]]
# [[Rule 3 - Sentences are built from equations|Rule 3]]
# [[Rule 4 - Later phrases modify earlier phrases|Rule 4]]

That's it!
