Here we see a use of the generic interrogative word [[kua]], meaning "what". Alice is equating [[sonu]] ("your name") with [[kua]] ("what"), forming an equation to ask Bob's name. Note that the bare «[[Su|su]]» at the beginning of the sentence is assigned as the subject by default. So this sentence is Alice asking Bob about himself ("as for you, what is (your) name?").
