To maximize compatibility and readability on various devices and platforms, Asgardian uses the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet]]. While there are no formal prohibitions on using proper nouns or personal names spelled using all the letters from A to Z (or even non-Latin characters), the core Asgardian vocabulary is built around a more restricted set of sounds common to the majority of world languages, and the limited alphabet used for these words is reflective of this decision:  ''A E H I K M N O P R S T U''.
