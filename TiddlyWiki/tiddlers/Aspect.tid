[[Grammatical aspect|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect]] is how an event or entity is distributed over time. Is something finished, or ongoing? Is it done and over-with, or does it continue to bear on the present? Was something formerly the case, but no longer? These situations and more can be handled with Asgardian's aspectual frame words.

In the examples below, each frame word is presented in a simple phrase so that the English translation is more readily understood.
