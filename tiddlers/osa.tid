''Usage notes''

The root [[osa]] is used to point the listener or reader to a discursively recent piece of information, typically in the same sentence. Its function is similar to "the above" or "what I just said". It can be useful to add a post-sentential tag indicating the tense, aspect, mood, or other "frame" of an utterance.
